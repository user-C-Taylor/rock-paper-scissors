# rock-paper-scissors
Initially, this is a console game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Later in the Odin curriculum, a GUI and related updates will be added.

## Console Game
To play the console game, navigate to the console game <a href='https://user-c-taylor.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/console-game/'>web page</a> and open the console (in Chrome: ctrl+shift+J on Linux/Windows, cmd+option+J on MacOS). Once there, call the <code>game();</code> function to start the game (type "game();" in the console and hit enter). A prompt will open to obtain your chosen selection for each round. You can adjust the width of the console if the prompt is covering part of the console.
